  <p> Hi, world. This is my first website! </p>
  <p> I'm a graduate student of ITM(Information technology and management). </p>
  <p> Through my work experiences, I have had many chances to work with IT people. </p>
  <p> From this class, I hope to understand the fundamental of IT, basic coding skills, to make a service for the better world and build an online library for my family. </p>
  <p> This class will help to get over this difficult season thinking more about the joy of life and I will learn how to convert it into code. </P>
  <p> Let's have fun togeter. Stay safe. </P>
